## Description of the project
Nomad is a mobile application which aims to help travellers explore new places by following a "for travellers, by travellers" approach, in which people can create routes, and others can search a route according to their preference of what type of journey they would like to go on and where they want to explore. Users can add stops to the routes they create on specific locations that they deem worthy of attention, which act as "checkpoints" for other users who follow that route. Using augmented reality, users that create routes can also add tokens to their routes for the route users to find, those who obtain such tokens can get achievements and unlockables.
